# raspberry-switch

This project was used to detect a chain of switch toggle in order to unlock a door.
This is used in a "Escape room" challenge.

The code is not optimized nor elegant. It was my first Raspberry-pi project and my first Python code. So bear with me on this...

The Circuit-Diagram.pdf is a schema of the board I did to attach all sensors and two relay to the Raspberry-Pi.
